= Configuration options =

Used post types can be setup (e.g. posts, product, pages). Using a matrix-like way you can set how to display different type of related items for every reference item types. For example you can configure how related POST, PAGE or PRODUCT settings displayed for POSTS.  Position, order of blocks, order of related items, match threshold, number of displayed related items limit, format (list or widgets), custom templates can be configured for each reference post types – related post type pair in the matrix.
Related items can be displayed right after the reference item, or on sidebar widgets.
PRO version

Cross taxonomies can be used to increase similarities using common categorization between different post types. For example, you can switch on standard post categories for products, so the post category assignment option appears not only on post edit page but on products admin page also. In this way, different post types can be in the same category, increasing the similarity rates.

Manual assignment of items is possible. This way you can define explicit relationship between different items (e.g. assign some product to a post or two related posts to each other)
